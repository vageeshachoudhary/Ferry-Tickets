# Ferry-Tickets App

###### A simple app that determines the total price for the fare in one direction depending on how many boat tickets the user needs and whether the ticket is for going to Catalina Island or heading back to Long Beach. Each single passenger ticket is $34.00 to Catalina Island and $40.00 for Long Beach for one way. The user types the number of tickets needed and selects a destination and then taps or clicks the “Computer Cost” button and the app displays the number of tickets and the total cost of the fare.
